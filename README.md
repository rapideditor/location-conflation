# location-conflation

üß© Define complex geographic regions ([geofences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo-fence)) by including and excluding country codes and GeoJSON shapes.


### What is it?

**Location-conflation** is a tool for generating [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) features by
including and excluding other locations and shapes.

It is useful for generating geofences in a declarative way, so your application doesn't need
to bundle or fetch so much geodata.

You can define a *locationSet* as an Object with `include` and `exclude` properties:
```js
const locationSet = {
  include: [ Array of locations ],
  exclude: [ Array of locations ]
};
```

The "locations" can be any of the following:

- Strings recognized by the [country-coder library](https://github.com/rapideditor/country-coder#readme).<br/>
  These include [ISO 3166-1 2 or 3 letter country codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_United_Nations_geoscheme), [UN M.49 numeric codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_M49), and supported Wikidata QIDs.<br/>
  _Examples: `"de"`, `"001"`, `"conus"`, `"gb-sct"`, `"Q620634"`_<br/>
  üëâ A current list of supported codes can be found at <https://ideditor.codes>

- Filenames for custom `.geojson` features. If you want to use your own features, pass them to the LocationConflation constructor in a `FeatureCollection`<br/>
  Each `Feature` must have an `id` that ends in `.geojson`.<br/>
  _Examples: `"de-hamburg.geojson"`, `"new_jersey.geojson"`_

- Circular areas defined as `[longitude, latitude, radius?]` Array.<br/>
  Radius is specified in kilometers and is optional. If not specified, it will default to a 25km radius.<br/>
  _Examples: `[8.67039, 49.41882]`, `[-88.3726, 39.4818, 32]`_


## Installing

### Use in Node

`npm install @rapideditor/location-conflation`

**location-conflation** is distributed in CJS and ESM module formats for maxmimum compatibility. ([Read more about Javascript module formats](https://dev.to/iggredible/what-the-heck-are-cjs-amd-umd-and-esm-ikm))


```js
const LocationConflation = require('@rapideditor/location-conflation').default;  // require CJS
// or
import { LocationConflation } from '@rapideditor/location-conflation';   // import ESM
```


### Use in Browsers

You can also use **location-conflation** directly in a web browser.  A good way to do this is to fetch the ["iife"](https://esbuild.github.io/api/#format-iife) bundle from the [jsDelivr CDN](https://www.jsdelivr.com/), which can even deliver minified versions.

When you load this file in a `<script>` tag, you'll get a `LocationConflation` global to use elsewhere in your scripts:
```html
<head>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@rapideditor/location-conflation@1.6/dist/location-conflation.iife.min.js"></script>
</head>
‚Ä¶
<script>
  var loco = new LocationConflation.default();
</script>
```

üëâ This project uses modern JavaScript syntax for use in supported node versions and modern browsers.  If you need support for legacy environments like ES5 or Internet Explorer, you'll need to build your own bundle with something like [Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/index.html).

## Examples
```js
import { LocationConflation } from '@rapideditor/location-conflation';
import myFeatures from './fixtures/features.json' with {type: 'json'};  // optional
const loco = new LocationConflation(myFeatures);
```

#### Southern Europe:
```js
const locationSet = { include: ['039'] };    // 039 = Southern Europe
const result = loco.resolveLocationSet(locationSet);
```

#### Southern Europe and Northern Africa:
```js
const locationSet = { include: ['039','015'] };   // 015 = Northern Africa
const result = loco.resolveLocationSet(locationSet);
```

#### The Alps, _excluding_ Liechtenstein and regions around Bern and Z√ºrich
```js
const result = loco.resolveLocationSet({ include: ['alps.geojson'], exclude: ['li', [8.55,47.36], [7.45,46.95]] });

<a name="constructor" href="#constructor">#</a> const <i>loco</i> = new <b>LocationConflation</b>(<i>featureCollection</i>)

Constructs a new LocationConflation instance.

Optionally pass a GeoJSON `FeatureCollection` of custom features which can be referred to later as locations.

Each feature *must* have a filename-like `id`, for example: `new_jersey.geojson`
```js
{
  "type": "FeatureCollection"
  "features": [
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "id": "new_jersey.geojson",
      "properties": { ‚Ä¶ },
      "geometry": { ‚Ä¶ }
    }
  ]
}
```

&nbsp;

<a name="validateLocation" href="#validateLocation">#</a> <i>loco</i>.<b>validateLocation</b>(<i>location</i>)

Validates a given location. The "locations" can be:
- Strings recognized by the [country-coder library](https://github.com/rapideditor/country-coder#readme). <br/>
  üëâ A current list of supported codes can be found at <https://ideditor.codes><br/>
  _Examples: `"de"`, `"001"`, `"conus"`, `"gb-sct"`, `"Q620634"`_

- Filename-like identifiers of custom `.geojson` features. <br/>
  _Examples: `"de-hamburg.geojson"`, `"new_jersey.geojson"`_

- Circular areas defined as `[longitude, latitude, radius?]` Array.<br/>
  Radius is specified in kilometers and is optional. If not specified, it will default to a 25km radius.<br/>
  _Examples: `[8.67039, 49.41882]`, `[-88.3726, 39.4818, 32]`_


If the location is valid, returns a result `Object` like:
```js
{
  type:     'point', 'geojson', or 'countrycoder'
  location:  the queried location
  id:        the stable identifier for the feature
}
```

If the location is invalid,
* _in strict mode_, throws an error
* _in non-strict mode_, returns `null`

&nbsp;

<a name="validateLocationSet" href="#validateLocationSet">#</a> <i>loco</i>.<b>validateLocationSet</b>(<i>locationSet</i>)

Validates a given locationSet. Pass a locationSet `Object` like:
```js
{
  include: [ Array of locations ],
  exclude: [ Array of locations ]
}
```

If the locationSet is valid, returns a result `Object` like:

```js
{
  type:         'locationset'
  locationSet:  the queried locationSet
  id:           the stable identifier for the feature
}
```

If the locationSet is invalid or contains any invalid locations,
* _in strict mode_, throws an error
* _in non-strict mode_, invalid locations are quietly ignored. A locationSet with nothing included will be considered valid, and will validate as if it were a locationSet covering the entire world.  `{ type: 'locationset', locationSet: ['Q2'], id: +[Q2] }`

&nbsp;

<a name="resolveLocation" href="#resolveLocation">#</a> <i>loco</i>.<b>resolveLocation</b>(<i>location</i>)

Resolves a given location into a GeoJSON feature.  This is similar to [validateLocation](#validateLocation), but runs slower and includes the actual GeoJSON in the result.  Results are cached, so if you ask for the same thing multiple times we don't repeat the expensive clipping operations.

The returned GeoJSON feature will also have an `area` property containing the approximate size of the feature in km¬≤.  (This is helpful for sorting features)

If the location is valid, returns a result `Object` like:
```js
{
  type:     'point', 'geojson', or 'countrycoder'
  location:  the queried location
  id:        the stable identifier for the feature
  feature:   the resolved GeoJSON feature
}
```

If the location is invalid,
* _in strict mode_, throws an error
* _in non-strict mode_, returns `null`

&nbsp;

  feature:      the resolved GeoJSON feature
}
```

If the locationSet is invalid or contains any invalid locations,
* _in strict mode_, throws an error
* _in non-strict mode_, invalid locations are quietly ignored. A locationSet with nothing included will be considered valid, and will validate as if it were a locationSet covering the entire world.  `{ type: 'locationset', locationSet: ['Q2'], id: +[Q2] }`

&nbsp;

<a name="strict" href="#strict">#</a> <i>loco</i>.<b>strict</b>(<i>val</i>)

Getter/setter for "strict mode".  Current versions of LocationConflation start out in strict mode by default.

* In strict mode, any invalid location or locationSet throws an error.
* In non strict mode, invalid locations are ignored, and locationSets that include nothing are assumed to include the entire world.

```js
loco.strict = false;            // setter: pass a true/false value to set the strict mode
const isStrict = loco.strict;   // getter: return the current value
```

&nbsp;

<a name="stringify" href="#stringify">#</a> <i>loco</i>.<b>stringify</b>(<i>object</i>, <i>options</i>)

Convenience method that wraps [json-stringify-pretty-compact](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aitodotai/json-stringify-pretty-compact) to stringify the given object. Optional `options` parameter gets passed through to json-stringify-pretty-compact.

```js
loco.stringify(someGeoJson, { maxLength: 100 });    // Make it pretty!
```
