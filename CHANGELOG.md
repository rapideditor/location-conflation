# 0.7.0
##### 2020-Dec-30
* Perf improvement: Don't union features iteratively with locationReducer ([#26])

[#26]: https://github.com/rapideditor/location-conflation/issues/26


# 0.6.0
##### 2020-Oct-26
* Update to country-coder v4


# 0.5.0
##### 2020-Aug-25
* ⚠️  Refactor - API now has:
  * `validateLocation` / `validateLocationSet` - fast, return stable ids
  * `resolveLocation` / `resolveLocationSet` - slower, resolve GeoJSON features
  * All functions now return similar result objects
* :warning: Introduce strict / non-strict modes.  Location-conflation defaults to "strict" mode now.
  * In strict mode, any invalid location or locationSet throws an error.
  * In non strict mode, invalid locations are ignored, and locationSets that include nothing are assumed to include the entire world.
  * Can change modes by calling `.strict(val)`, for example:<br/>
    `const loco = new LocationConflation(features).strict(false);    // not strict`
* Add tests and document everything


# 0.4.0
##### 2020-Aug-20
* Replace turf with mfogel/polygon-clipping ([#1], [#2], [#20])
* Include `stringify` convenience method
* Update country-coder and other dependencies

# 0.3.0

* Handle cases like UK which have both members _and_ geometry ([#4])
* :warning: Breaking changes: several function renames and changes to internals
  * `locationToFeature()` -> `resolveLoation()`
  * `isValidLocation()` -> `validateLocation()`
  * Copy country-coder features rather than modifying inplace (less hacky)
  * Use wikidata identifiers as the country coder feature ids and cache keys now
* Update country-coder dependency

[#4]: https://github.com/rapideditor/location-conflation/issues/4


# 0.2.0
##### 2020-Jan-15
